# Code Coverage Dashboard Widgets
This repository contains a collection of [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) and Team Foundation Services (TFS) dashboard widgets that can be used to extract unit test code coverage metrics right into your dashboards.

NOTE: This works with Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server. However, Microsoft requires TFS 2015 Update 3 or higher for folks using Team Foundation Server.
